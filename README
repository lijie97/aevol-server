#  Aevol - An in silico experimental evolution platform
#
###############################################################################
# 
#  Aevol is a digital genetics model: populations of digital organisms are
#  subjected to a process of selection and variation, which creates a
#  Darwinian dynamics.
#  .
#  By modifying the characteristics of selection (e.g. population size,
#  type of environment, environmental variations) or variation (e.g.
#  mutation rates, chromosomal rearrangement rates, types of
#  rearrangements, horizontal transfer), one can study experimentally the
#  impact of these parameters on the structure of the evolved organisms.
#  In particular, since Aevol integrates a precise and realistic model of
#  the genome, it allows for the study of structural variations of the
#  genome (e.g. number of genes, synteny, proportion of coding sequences).
#  .
#  The simulation platform comes along with a set of tools for analysing
#  phylogenies and measuring many characteristics of the organisms and
#  populations along evolution.

The complete documentation being quite heavy, it is not included in basic
distributions. Please visit www.aevol.fr


To take a quick tour, please take the following steps:

1) install aevol
  cd into the main dir
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

  (see INSTALL in the main dir or run ./configure --help for more information)

  NOTE: If you don't have sudo rights or simply don't want to install aevol
  just yet, skip the "sudo make install" step and run the executables "locally"
  with ../../src/aevol_create and ../../src/aevol_run_X11


2) To run an example, cd into it then run:
   aevol_create
   aevol_run_X11
   
The first command will create an experiment with the parameters contained
in the "param.in" file
The second command will launch the simulation for 1000 generations
(use --nbgener XXX or -n XXX to run for XXX generations)

For more information, please see the manpages (e.g. man aevol_create), run any
executable with the -h option (e.g. aevol_create -h) and ultimately visit 
www.aevol.fr
