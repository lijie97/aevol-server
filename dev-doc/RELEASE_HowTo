RELEASE HowTo

1) Update version number
  -> in configure.ac
  -> in all the manpages (update date too)
  -> in the user guide (if needed)

2) Write an entry in the NEWS file for users
   and in ChangeLog for developers.

3) [TEMPRORARY as long as tests are scarce]
  -> Remove tests directories (aevol/tests, aevol/src/tests, /misc/unitary_tests)
  -> Remove references to tests in configure.ac, src/Makefile.am

3') Clean up examples: remove all computed data files

4) Run the following commands (from aevol root dir)
  -> autoreconf
  -> ./configure
  -> make dist

  This will generate a file called aevol-X.Y.tar.gz in aevol root dir

  -> Check that the archive is sound (decompresses, compilesâ€¦)

5) Add a version in the "files" section of the forge
  -> In the "files" section click on the link to "create a new version"
  -> Fill in the form with
    - num version of the form X.Y
    - File format: Source .gz
    - Arch type: Any
    - Copy-Paste your entry from the NEWS file in section "Notes"
    - Check the "preformatted text" checkbox
  -> Publish

6) Write an entry on the website
  -> TODO (will probably change soon)
