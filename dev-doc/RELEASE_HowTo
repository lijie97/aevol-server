RELEASE HowTo

1) Update version number
  -> in configure.ac
  -> in all the manpages (update date too)
     tip -- USE WITH CAUTION:
     sed -i 's/\.TH AEVOL "1" .*$/.TH AEVOL "1" "<MONTH YEAR>" "<VERSION>" "User Manual"/' *.1
  -> in the user guide (if needed)

2) Write an entry in the NEWS file for users
   and in ChangeLog for developers.

2') Record status in version manager
  -> git commit
  -> git tag vXXX

3) [TEMPRORARY as long as tests are scarce]
  -> Remove tests directories (aevol/tests, aevol/src/tests, aevol/src/misc/unitary_tests)
  -> Remove references to tests in configure.ac, src/Makefile.am

3') Clean up examples: remove all computed data files

4) Run the following commands (from aevol root dir)
  -> autoreconf
  -> ./configure
  -> check that aevol compiles and runs
  -> make dist

  This will generate a file called aevol-X.Y.tar.gz in aevol root dir

  -> Check that the archive is sound (decompresses, compilesâ€¦)

4') Record status in version manager
  -> git checkout --detach (to record the tarball base on a tag-identified anonymous branch)
  -> commit with message like "Remove tests (for tarball release)"
  -> git tag vXXX-tarball
  -> git push origin v5.0-tarball
  -> git checkout master
  -> git push --tags
  -> git push

5) Add a version in the "files" section of the forge
  -> In the "files" section click on the link to "create a new version"
  -> Fill in the form with
    - num version of the form X.Y
    - File format: Source .gz
    - Arch type: Any
    - Copy-Paste your entry from the NEWS file in section "Notes"
    - Check the "preformatted text" checkbox
  -> Publish

6) Write an entry on the website
  -> TODO (will probably change soon)
