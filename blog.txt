* cout vs printf
2015-10-08 vld

It is often reported that C++ streams are slow. I don't exactly know
what is meant by this. But I break it down to the question of 'cout'
and the 'endl' stream manipulator.

** 'endl'
'endl' is indeed slower than a mere '\n' because it produces a flush
on top of it. The consequence is that 'endl' should only be used when
explicitely intending to emit a flush.

** 'cout'
'cout' on the other hand is not slow, it's rather faster than 'printf'

See Hexagon's comment on:

** further investigations
*** Better practices?
From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/213907/c-stdendl-vs-n:
@legends2k: There is an old wives tale that C++ streams are not as
performant as C printf(). Though true to an extent the main difference
in speed is caused by people using C++ streams
incorrectly. stackoverflow.com/a/1042121/14065 In C++ remember to
unsync iostreams with C-streams sync_with_stdio(false) and don't flush
your output continuously. Let the library work out when to do
it. stackoverflow.com/a/1926432/14065 â€“ Loki Astari Jan 22 '14 at
